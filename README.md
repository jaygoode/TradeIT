this is a frontend project where I learned to hook up to an API endpoint  https://fakeapi.platzi.com/.
key learning points were TypeScript, React-Redux, API calls and methods, and Material UI

contains:
-user authentication
-user roles: admin and customer
-CRUD operations for users and store items
-theme switching
-shopping cart
-page navigation and item limit per page
